            <h1>UX Design App Case Study</h1>
            <p class="speech-bubble left"><span>The product:</span>The Plant Shop Mobile App I designed is a
                user-friendly platform aimed at providing an intuitive and seamless shopping experience for plant
                lovers, enabling them to browse, purchase, and learn more about various plants offered by "Green Haven,"
                a local plant nursery.</p>
            <p class="speech-bubble left"><span>Project duration:</span>July 2024 to November 2024</p>
            <p class="speech-bubble left"><span>Problem:</span>Plant lovers often have trouble buying plants because
                there isn't a simple app for browsing different plants, learning how to care for them, or ordering them
                online. Without an easy-to-use platform, shopping for plants can be a hassle. To fix this, I designed a
                mobile app that makes plant shopping easier and provides helpful plant care information.</p>
            <p class="speech-bubble left"><span>Goal:</span>The goal of this portfolio project is to showcase my UX
                design skills by creating a mobile app for Green Haven that improves plant accessibility, simplifies the
                shopping experience, and fosters customer engagement, ultimately leading to greater satisfaction among
                plant buyers.</p>

                <span>What was learned:</span> Throughout the design process, several key insights were gained.
                Understanding user needs through research and usability studies emphasized the importance of intuitive
                navigation and a visually appealing design for the Plant Shop app. Iterative testing and feedback were
                critical in refining the app's functionality, ensuring that it aligned with user expectations for
                browsing plants, reading care tips, and making purchases. Additionally, the importance of accessibility
                and offering customization options, such as personalized plant recommendations, became evident, leading
                to design decisions that boosted user satisfaction.

                fully functional Plant Shop mobile app. This will involve close collaboration with developers to ensure
                the design is implemented smoothly in a real-world application. Continuous user testing will be
                conducted to gather insights and make iterative improvements. Future enhancements may include
                integrating features like loyalty programs, personalized plant care reminders, and advanced order
                tracking to further enrich the user experience and drive engagement.
