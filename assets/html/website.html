            <p class="speech-bubble right">
                <span>Impact:</span> The new Plant Shop website will enhance online visibility, simplify the shopping
                experience with detailed product descriptions and an easy purchasing process, and increase overall
                sales. It will attract new customers, boost satisfaction and loyalty among plant enthusiasts,
                and strengthen the shopâ€™s brand image, driving business growth.
            </p>
            <p class="speech-bubble left">
                <span>What was learned:</span> Throughout the design process for the Plant Shop website, I gained
                valuable insights into the importance of focusing on user needs and preferences. By conducting in-depth
                user research, including surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis, I learned to identify customer
                pain points and design solutions that address them effectively. Understanding the importance of detailed
                plant care information, easy online purchasing,
                and a seamless mobile experience has underscored the areas where the website can make the biggest impact
                on improving the overall user experience
            </p>
            <p class="speech-bubble right">
                <span>Next steps:</span>Moving forward, the next steps for the Plant Shop website project include
                several key actions. First, prototype testing will be conducted to gather user feedback and refine the
                design before launch. Following that, content creation will focus on developing engaging and informative
                text, including plant care guides and high-quality visuals to enhance storytelling. Technical
                development will then begin to implement the design using an appropriate technology stack. Finally,
                the website will be launched and promoted to drive traffic, with ongoing improvements based on user
                feedback and analytics, ensuring the platform evolves to meet the changing needs of its customers over
                time.
